Nice—got your repo. I can see the PlugIQ-Tools README, MIT license, pyproject.toml, and the usb_cable_tester/ package. The README already documents features, quick start, wizard/TUI flags, safety notes, and a roadmap (DP Alt Mode, active/passive detection, guided flows). ￼

Here’s a fast, surgical audit + upgrades to make this feel like a polished, installable CLI that people trust on first contact:

Tighten the packaging

Add a console entry point so users can run plugiq (or usbct) after pip install:

# pyproject.toml

[project]
name = "plugiq-tools"
version = "1.0.0"
description = "Smart USB-C Cable Tester — probe capabilities & measure real-world throughput"
readme = "README.md"
license = { text = "MIT" }
requires-python = ">=3.8"
dependencies = [

# e.g., "rich>=13", "textual>=0.58", "psutil", "typer>=0.12", "py-cpuinfo", etc.

]

[project.scripts]
plugiq = "usb_cable_tester.**main**:main"
usbct = "usb_cable_tester.**main**:main" # optional alias

[tool.setuptools.package-data]
usb_cable_tester = ["py.typed"]

In usb_cable_tester/**main**.py expose main() that wires your CLI/TUI. Then your README “Install from source” can add:

pip install .
plugiq --help
plugiq --wizard
plugiq --tui

(Your README already shows module-style invocation and flags like --wizard, --tui, --show-system, and banner style env var—great signal; this just smooths the UX to a single command.) ￼

README polish (trust signals + clarity)
• Put your ASCII banner + tagline right at the top (the one we made).
• Add badges: MIT, Python versions, Tested OSes, Release tag.
• Split Usage into quick “Do this first” tasks:
• Probe: plugiq --show-system
• Safe guided run: plugiq --wizard
• Targeted speed test (with safe defaults): plugiq --run-speed-test --test-path ... --save
• Add a “What PlugIQ infers vs guarantees” box so users understand the e-marker caveat and OS exposure limits. Your README already emphasizes OS caps and that throughput depends on the attached device; surface that in a bold callout. ￼
• Add a Results format snippet (JSON example of a saved run) so folks know what “save” gives them.

Safety & UX details (you’re already thinking about these)
• Keep your preflight checks and “don’t write to system root / internal drive” guardrails front-and-center; you already note this in safety notes and wizard logic—good. Maybe print a one-line “Test file will be deleted” confirmation right before I/O starts. ￼
• For Windows: print an honest capability level (e.g., “Limited USB-C detail available on this OS; falling back to PowerShell + device manager hints”), which your README already hints at. ￼

CLI ergonomics
• Short flags for common things:
• -w/--wizard, -t/--tui, -p/--test-path, -s/--file-size-mb, -l/--label, -S/--save.
• A --json switch to dump machine-readable output for automation.
• A --diagnostics mode to print “how I figured this out” (USB tree, Thunderbolt link status, Linux type-C sysfs paths) without requiring users to spelunk logs.

TUI niceties
• Key hints footer: ←/→ tabs ↑/↓ select Enter run Q quit.
• A compact mini-banner to avoid blasting the full art on every screen.
• If using Textual/Rich, add a sparkline or simple bar for write speed progression.

Tests & CI
• Add a few unit tests for classification logic (USB 2.0 vs USB 3.2 Gen1/Gen2 vs USB4/TB) with synthetic inputs.
• Add smoke tests that stub the filesystem for throughput to ensure flags parse and guardrails work.
• Minimal GitHub Action: run pytest, ruff/flake8, and build a wheel. A release workflow can publish to PyPI when you tag vX.Y.Z.

Versioning & releases
• You’ve got CHANGELOG.md and a RELEASE_NOTES_v1.0.0.md—excellent. Automate release notes from tags and consider semantic versioning. ￼

Roadmap items (you already listed them)
• DP Alt Mode detection across OSes where APIs exist.
• Active/passive detection on macOS/Windows if you can reach TB/USB4 descriptors.
• Guided flows for storage/network/display to cover more real-world protocols. ￼

Name & command
• Keep the repo as PlugIQ-Tools and ship the binary as plugiq with usbct as a friendly alias. Your README already uses usb_cable_tester as the module name—clean to keep; just map it to plugiq. ￼

If you want, I can generate: 1. a drop-in **main**.py (Typer or argparse), 2. a ready-to-paste GitHub Actions workflow for tests + packaging, and 3. a README top section with badges and install/usage blocks tuned to PlugIQ’s current features.
